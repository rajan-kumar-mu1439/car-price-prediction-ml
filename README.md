<h1>Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning</h1>

🧾Summary :

✅Predicts the resale price of cars based on key features using supervised machine learning models.

🔍 Overview

✅This project focuses on building a machine learning model that estimates the selling price of used cars.

✅The goal is to understand how different factors such as car age, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and ownership affect the market value of a car.

✅The project covers the complete ML pipeline: data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

❓ Problem Statement :

✅Analyze factors influencing car prices.

✅Build a predictive model for car resale value.

✅Reduce human bias and guesswork in pricing decisions.

📊 Dataset

✅Source:<a href="https://github.com/rajan-kumar-mu1439/car-price-prediction-ml">Used car sales dataset</a>

✅Records: Contains historical data of car listings

👉Key Features:

✅Car Name / Brand

✅Year

✅Present Price

✅Kms Driven

✅Fuel Type

✅Seller Type

✅Transmission

✅Owner

✅Target Variable: Selling Price

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

👉Programming Language: Python 🐍

👉Libraries Used:

✅NumPy, ✅Pandas, ✅Matplotlib, ✅Seaborn, ✅Scikit-learn

✅Environment: Jupyter Notebook

⚙️ Methods & Approach

✅ Data Loading & Inspection

✅ Data Cleaning (missing values, outliers)

✅ Feature Encoding (categorical → numerical)

✅ Feature Scaling (if required)

✅ Train-Test Split

✅ Model Training

🔹Linear Regression

🔹Random Forest Regressor

✅ Model Evaluation (R² Score, MAE)

✅ Price Prediction

💡 Key Insights

✅Car age has a strong negative correlation with selling price

✅Cars with lower mileage tend to have higher resale value

✅Fuel type and transmission significantly impact pricing

✅Ensemble models outperform basic linear models

📉 Model / Output

✅Trained regression models for price prediction

✅Comparison of actual vs predicted prices

✅Feature importance visualization

✅Final model capable of predicting car price for new inputs


👉 Results & Conclusion

✅The Random Forest model achieved better accuracy than Linear Regression.

✅The model provides reliable price estimates for used cars.

✅Demonstrates practical application of regression in real-world scenarios.

🚀 Future Work

✅Deploy model using Flask / FastAPI.

✅Build a web-based car price prediction app.

✅Add more features (location, car condition, brand reputation).

✅Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy.
